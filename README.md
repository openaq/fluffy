This is an internal watchdog, run on a regular basis to ensure that the system is still fetching new data. If it notices any irregularities, it'll send emails and/or messages to the OpenAQ #alerts Slack channel.

Right now it's very basic, only making sure that fetches have come in within the last 20 minutes, but it can be expanded in the future.
